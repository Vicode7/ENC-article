        <article class="article-page-content">
            <p class="article-intro">“If your job gets replaced by AI, you’re a bot.” This is a fear very common among college students; we all have this uncertainty about our careers and how will they be impacted by AI. We don’t know if when we finish our degree, the job position that we are working towards for is still going to exist. Well, this bold statement that I quoted is not just made to grab attention in social media, it is actually very real. In his Forbes article, Jack Kelly explains that AI will and is already replacing repetitive, routine tasks. But it is not yet capable of replacing an entire job position unless your only job is doing repetitive tasks. So that’s where the statement comes from. AI is not replacing you, at least not in the next few years, unless all you do is bot work. This concept supports Google’s AI chief statement that “learning how to learn will be the skill of the future.” We will need to be constantly learning new skills, human and technical, new technologies and new AI models. Artificial intelligence will rapidly transform the job market by automating repetitive tasks, demanding new technical and human skills, and widening the gap between those who embrace these tools and those who resist them.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The first Jobs that AI will replace.</h2>
                <p>AI will rarely replace whole positions, but it is already automating repetitive tasks from entry-level jobs. Changing what entry-level means. For example, in Jack Kelly’s article <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/11/26/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/?sh=7b68eeffffff">“The Jobs That Will Fall First as AI Takes Over the Workplace”</a>, he explains that “data entry, scheduling, and customer service” are jobs that are already being “overtaken by AI tools.” Giving example of entry-level jobs that are already being automated . Then a Baxate, a TikTok software engineer that talks a lot about the tech job market, said that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@baxate_carter/video/7470198554229837098?_r=1&_t=ZT-91eZIGPN7wD">“simple tasks in organized manner”</a> are the most exposed. Baxate highlights jobs based on doing simple tasks as the most vulnerable, these types of jobs are usually given to entry-level workers so they can start to understand the company and the tasks they will be performing in a future. Finally, a 2024 systematic review of AI in the workplace found that AI is being used to “streamline workflows, automate tasks” across multiple sectors. All of this means that companies will cease to pay you to just follow a script. Entry level jobs will require people to manage, analyze, and improve what AI is doing, not just performing repetitive tasks yourself, opening the way to a new problem, who adapt and who doesn’t.</p>
