            <p class="article-intro">“If your job gets replaced by AI, you’re a bot.” This is a fear very common among college students; we all have this uncertainty about our careers and how will they be impacted by AI. We don’t know if when we finish our degree, the job position that we are working towards for is still going to exist. Well, this bold statement that I quoted is not just made to grab attention in social media, it is actually very real. In his Forbes article, Jack Kelly explains that AI will and is already replacing repetitive, routine tasks. But it is not yet capable of replacing an entire job position unless your only job is doing repetitive tasks. So that’s where the statement comes from. AI is not replacing you, at least not in the next few years, unless all you do is bot work. This concept supports Google’s AI chief statement that “learning how to learn will be the skill of the future.” We will need to be constantly learning new skills, human and technical, new technologies and new AI models. Artificial intelligence will rapidly transform the job market by automating repetitive tasks, demanding new technical and human skills, and widening the gap between those who embrace these tools and those who resist them.</p>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h2 class="section-heading">The first Jobs that AI will replace.</h2>
                <p>AI will rarely replace whole positions, but it is already automating repetitive tasks from entry-level jobs. Changing what entry-level means. For example, in Jack Kelly’s article <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/11/26/the-jobs-that-will-fall-first-as-ai-takes-over-the-workplace/?sh=7b68eeffffff">“The Jobs That Will Fall First as AI Takes Over the Workplace”</a>, he explains that “data entry, scheduling, and customer service” are jobs that are already being “overtaken by AI tools.” Giving example of entry-level jobs that are already being automated . Then a Baxate, a TikTok software engineer that talks a lot about the tech job market, said that <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@baxate_carter/video/7470198554229837098?_r=1&_t=ZT-91eZIGPN7wD">“simple tasks in organized manner”</a> are the most exposed. Baxate highlights jobs based on doing simple tasks as the most vulnerable, these types of jobs are usually given to entry-level workers so they can start to understand the company and the tasks they will be performing in a future. Finally, a 2024 systematic review of AI in the workplace found that AI is being used to “streamline workflows, automate tasks” across multiple sectors. All of this means that companies will cease to pay you to just follow a script. Entry level jobs will require people to manage, analyze, and improve what AI is doing, not just performing repetitive tasks yourself, opening the way to a new problem, who adapt and who doesn’t.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The New Inequality – Adaptors vs. Resistors</h2>
                <p>AI will widen the gap between people who adapt to it and learn how to use it for their benefit and those who totally reject it thinking their degree or experience will be enough. For example, there was a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/14407833221089365">sociology research</a>, conducted by Lilla Vicsek, Tamás Bokor and Gyöngyvér Pataki, where they conclude that college students are aware of what experts say AI and how it will change most jobs but still think it won't affect their own career. This huge optimism is holding them back on preparing or learning new key skills for this change and leaving them vulnerable to when the adjustment actually arrives. There's other risks like the one presented in a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16078">study about automation and knowledge transmission</a> by Enrique Ide where he states that as AI and new technologies take over early career task that used to be done under the guidance of experienced workers, a lot of the learning and mentoring that we receive when we are at the job by this older people with more experience will disappear. Hurting younger workers without much experience who can use some mentoring by people on the field or in the company for more years. Other <a href="https://globalresearchnetwork.us/index.php/ajebm/article/view/3355">research about business and AI</a>, shows how companies that invest in AI training for their workforce instead of just expecting for people to figure it out on their own will see higher productivity than those who adapt AI without supporting their workers. With all these ideas tied together we can conclude that: AI won't create inequality by itself, but people and companies who choose not to adapt entirely, will make the distance between them and those who adapt to keep growing.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">The Skills That Survive and Thrive in an AI World</h2>
                <p>As AI comes to replace some of the repetitive parts of work, what can we change to remain competitive? A <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3387/14/6/127">systematic review</a> by Leili Babashahi and her colleagues found a pattern in this case, AI is better at routine tasks, but humans are still essential when it comes to problem-solving and skill development. This study highlights that continuous learning will be the key in the AI drive future, we won't make it by just learning what is essential to get the job and stopping there. A <a href="https://www.informingscience.org/Publications/5078">second study</a> that focuses on what skills workers will need as AI gets into the organizations states that companies shouldn't just focus in training people how to use AI but also invest in soft skills like communication and collaboration that can be transferred to several jobs and roles. Finally, the CEO of DeepMind in an interview for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/greece-google-artificial-intelligence-hassabis-85bff114c30cbea4b951ab93dcc1e6d1">AP news</a> said that the most important skill to learn will be "learning how to learn" as AI will be speeding up change in both school and work. This makes sense as we don't know what technologies we will be using in ten years but by constantly updating our skills we can build a habit that will prepare us for whatever tools we use in the future. By this we can say that the workers that will most likely survive and thrive, are those that combine technical skills, human skills, and are prepared to be constantly learning and adapting.</p>

                <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                <p>So, yea, "If your job gets replaced by AI, you're a bot." Because AI is already here, automating tasks, and widening the gap between those who adapt and those who reject it. Everyone, from researchers to influencers, is pointing to the same statement: the safest place in this AI-driven job markets are to learn how to work with AI instead of being afraid to it. We are not doomed, but if your only job is to do some routinary tasks that any AI nowadays can do, then you're doomed to be a bot. So, if you're still not into the job market, know that the entry-level jobs of your career will most certainly change. But research shows it, if you don't want to be hurt by the changes that come with AI you will need to invest time to learn new skills.</p>
                <p>Now stop asking "Will AI take my job?" that's a bot question. Start asking yourself, "What am I doing to make myself stay competitive with AI?" All the research that I showed to you point in the same direction: learning AI, having a wide skill set of technical and human skills, and being prepared to continuously learn, will all matter the most. Now treat AI like a team member, not an enemy. You don't need to make a huge change or take a big step for now. You can start by asking yourself, "What tasks in my future job will most likely be automated?" or "What skills can I learn that AI won't be able to replace?" And tomorrow start by using one AI tool that you are not familiarized with to perform a task that you will be performing in your future job so you can learn how AI can help you do it not only faster, but better too. Then continue by practicing a new human skill like communication. You can try looking for people in your same career and asking them to do a project together to see how you perform in team scenarios and practice that communication. Finally, you must start developing that learning habit, pick a course and a newsletter that talks about technologies in your field, anytime there's a new technology mentioned in the newsletter try to learn something new about it and figure out what "new thing" it brings that others don't. Change starts NOW, you decide if you ride the bus to success or become the shadow of AI.</p>
